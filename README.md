# Habit Quest üöÄ  

Welcome to **Habit Quest**, a gamified habit-tracking app designed to make building habits fun, engaging, and effective!

## üåê **Links**  
- **Web App:** [Habit Quest Web Version](https://www.papps.io/)  
- **Download App:** [Habit Quest APK](https://github.com/lewiseman/solutech_habit_quest/blob/main/app_resources/app-release.apk)

## üìå **Good to Know**

While building this app, I initially started with **Appwrite** for data storage and authentication. However, I faced issues with Appwrite's Google login, so I switched to **Firebase** as  last minute solution for authentication while keeping **Appwrite** for data storage.

## üîç **Overview**

Habit Quest allows you to:
- Create, edit, delete, pause, and skip habits effortlessly.
- Focus on active habits only‚Äîpaused habits won‚Äôt show up on your dashboard.  
- Work both **online and offline**, thanks to an **offline-first approach** using Hive for local data storage.

The result is a seamless experience whether you're connected or not.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Run**

To get the app running, here‚Äôs what you need to know:

| **Requirement**               | **Version**                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Flutter                       | 3.24.5                        |

1. **Important Compatibility Note:**  
   Some versions of Flutter may conflict with the latest Android Studio updates, so please double-check compatibility.  

2. **Building the App:**  
   - The app is signed because Firebase signup requires it. Signing details are stored securely in the project's secrets.  
   - You can:
     - Build the **release version** using GitHub Actions.  
     - Build the **development version** locally.

## üåü **Features Overview**

### **Authentication**
Here‚Äôs how users can log in or sign up:  
- **Email and Password:** Fully implemented and functional.  
- **Google Sign-In:** Also supported for quick access.  

---

### **Habits Management**
The core of the app is managing habits. Here‚Äôs what you can do:  

| **Action**         | **How It Works**                                                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create Habit**    | Use the floating action button on the habits page to add a new habit.                              |
| **Edit Habit**      | Tap on a habit, select "Edit" from the popup menu, or manage it via the "My Habits" section.       |
| **Delete Habit**    | Go to "My Habits," tap the habit, and select "Delete."                                             |
| **Pause Habit**     | Pause a habit via "My Habits" to temporarily exclude it from your main dashboard.                  |
| **Skip Habit**      | Skip any upcoming habit directly from the dashboard.                                               |
| **Track Progress**  | View habit summaries and analytics on the "Journey" page under the "Summary" tab.                  |

---

### **Gamification**
To make habit tracking fun and rewarding, I added these gamified features:  

| **Feature**           | **Description**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stats, Coins, Levels** | View your progress and achievements on the profile page.                                       |
| **Rewards**            | Earn a coin every time you complete a habit on time, with a fun animation for extra motivation.  |
| **Challenges**         | Explore predefined habits on the "Journey" page's "Explore" tab and add them to your list.       |
| **Badges**             | Unlock badges as you progress, viewable on the profile page.                                     |
| **Buy Items**          | Use your coins to buy avatars on the profile page.                                               |
| **Levels**             | Gain levels as you earn more coins (5 coins = 1 level).                                          |

---

### **Offline-First Functionality**
This app works flawlessly offline:  
- You can create, edit, delete, pause, and skip habits without needing an internet connection.  
- Data is stored locally using Hive and synced with the server when you‚Äôre back online.  
- The profile page displays your sync status, and you can manually trigger a sync if needed.

---

### **Notifications**
- **Automated Notifications:** When you create a habit, reminders are set up automatically.  
- **Customization:** You can adjust how many minutes before a habit starts you‚Äôd like to be notified.  
- **Settings:** Enable, disable, or refresh notifications in the settings page to troubleshoot.  

---

### **Theme and Responsiveness**
The app is designed to look great on any device:  
- **Responsive Design:** On mobile, there‚Äôs a bottom navigation bar, while web versions use a sidebar for navigation.  
- **Themes:** Switch between light and dark modes on the settings page.

---

## üöÄ **CI/CD Pipeline**

To streamline development and deployment, I‚Äôve set up CI/CD processes:  

| **Action**          | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Web Deployment**   | Builds and deploys the web version to **Netlify**.                                               |
| **Mobile Builds**    | Automatically generates signed APKs and app bundles, uploaded as artifacts via GitHub Actions, the signing key is stored in the repo's secrets.   |
